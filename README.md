# For our group project, we plan to develop a Python application that analyzes the 2022-2023 NBA season stats. The question we aim to answer is “Is there a significant correlation between NBA players' salaries and their performance across various statistical categories, such as points, assists, rebounds?”

We aim to identify insights such as top-performing players in different categories such as points per game, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, turnovers, fouls, and minutes played. We will also explore advanced stats like Box Plus-Minus (BPM) Additionally, we will compare player stats with their salaries and analyze which positions tend to receive the highest salaries. 


The APIs that we plan on using are the following:

Additional Kaggle Sets:

The visualizations that we think will most clearly visualize our findings are bar chart, scatter plot, and heatmap. Bar chart will be suitable for comparing top-performing players per category and to show salary distribution by position. Scatter plot will be suitable for analyzing relationships between salary and performance stats. Heatmap will be suitable for showing correlations between multiple stats and salary distributions.
